This is my capstone project for Northwestern University's Master of Science in Data Science program. I worked with three other students to develop machine learning models that help MarginEdge's clients (restaurant owners) predict their upcoming sales. Because the dataset and our oral presentation contain sensitive information about the clients, I cannot upload them here. Thank you in advance for your understanding.
